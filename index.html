These are crispy on the outside and so sweet and creamy on the inside. Try this cheese blintzes recipe and you'll be making them again and again.<p></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Homemade Cheese Blintz:</p><p>These cheese blintzes are similar to the ones served at IHOP. They are also served on many Jewish holidays.</p><p><br /></p><p>The deliciously thin pancakes are very similar to Norwegian pancakes, so you don't even need to fill them, but this creamy sweet filling is something you don't want to miss.</p><p><br /></p><p>Easy Cheese Blintzes:</p><p>This recipe will help you create some of the best cheese blintzes you've ever had. One of the keys to getting the right texture for blint pancakes is to let the dough rest in the refrigerator.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>This allows the flour to rise and produces a batter that can make the perfect blintz pancake that will hold and crisp beautifully.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>What are Cheese Blintzes?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>If you've ever had a crepe, then you're on the right track. Cheese blintzes are small thin pancakes filled with a creamy sweet filling, folded and fried to perfection.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Cheese Blintz is a Jewish recipe that can be served for breakfast or as a dessert.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Are crepes and blintzes the same thing?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Although they may look somewhat similar, they are not exactly the same thing. They come from different places. The crepe has a French origin and the Blitze has a Jewish origin.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Crepes can be served in a variety of ways. Sometimes they fill up. Other times they are served with the fillings on the side so you can make them with whatever you like.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>However, cheese blintzes are always filled with a creamy filling, folded and fried. They are like little crunchy pillows of sweet creamy heaven.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Cheese Blintz Ingredients:</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Most of what you will need for this recipe you will already have at home. Take a look and make sure you're ready to go. Here is a list of what you need:</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Eggs</p><p>Milk</p><p>All purpose flour</p><p>Sugar</p><p>Vanilla extract</p><p>Salt</p><p>Ricotta cheese</p><p>Cream cheese</p><p>lemon juice</p><p>Butter</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Ingredient Notes and Substitutions:</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>If you don't like ricotta cheese, you can try replacing it with cottage cheese.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Also, if you want to make these gluten-free, replace the all-purpose flour with King Arthur Gluten-Free Flour with Measured Flour.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>How to make Cheese Blintz:</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Start by making the pancake batter in a medium bowl. Add the eggs and milk and beat them well.</p><p>Add the flour, sugar, vanilla extract and salt.</p><p>Mix it all together then place a piece of plastic over the bowl and let it chill in the fridge for an hour before making the pancakes.</p><p>While the batter is chilling, prepare the cheese filling by combining the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, egg, lemon juice and vanilla in a small mixing bowl.</p><p>Mix everything together until well combined. However, there may still be lumps left and that's okay, they will go away when cooked.</p><p>After the time is up, heat a small non-stick pan over medium heat. Then spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray.</p><p>Using a ladle, drop about 3 ounces of batter into the oiled pan and swirl it around so the batter spreads and becomes runny. It should cover the bottom of the pan.</p><p>Let the pancake cook for about 60 seconds, allowing it to fluff up and dry out.</p><p>Then flip the pancake over and let it cook for another 15 seconds on the other side. The blintz should be golden brown.</p><p>Transfer the pancake to a wire rack to cool when finished cooking.</p><p>Repeat these steps with each pancake until the batter is gone. Don't forget to spray the pan again with non-stick cooking spray.</p><p>After the pancakes have cooled, you will begin assembling the cheeseburgers.</p><p>Place a small amount of cheese filling on the bottom third of a pancake.</p><p>Then invert the bottom with the cheese filling halfway up the pancake. Then fold the two sides of the pancake in half.</p><p>Then fold the top down to finish. They will look like little cheese burritos.</p><p>Repeat these steps until all the pancakes are filled.</p><p>Finish the blintzes by browning them in the small pan with a little butter and brown both sides of the blintzes starting from the folded side down. This should take about 60 seconds.</p><p>Serve with your favorite toppings.</p><p>Recipe notes and tips:</p><p><br /></p><p>Batting requires a step you don't normally take. Mix the dough ingredients and let it rest in the bowl for about an hour in the fridge. The flour expands and the texture of the batter improves. So be patient at that time.</p><p><br /></p><p>To make up for this, you can prepare the blintzes in advance. Then all you have to do is stuff them and brown them just before serving.</p><p><br /></p><p>I find that if you use a ladle you will get an even size. This makes rolling blintzes very useful. I like to prepare mine in either a small pan or a large baking pan if I need to make a few batches at once.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can add powdered sugar, fruit, preserves, a small dollop of cream or even eat them plain. It does not matter.</p><p><br /></p><p>How do you fold a blintz?</p><p><br /></p><p>You will essentially be making little miniature burritos out of the little pancakes. It only takes 3 easy steps.</p><p><br /></p><p>Place a small amount of the cheese filling on the bottom third of the pancake.</p><p>Turn the bottom part over with the cheese filling up to the middle of the pancake.</p><p>Fold the two sides of the pancake towards the middle.</p><p>Are blintzes a dessert?</p><p>It can be! Not strictly a dessert, but they can be served as one! But they also work great as a breakfast dish!</p><p><br /></p><p>What do you serve with cheese blintzes?</p><p><br /></p><p>You can serve cheese blintzes with a variety of toppings. Here are some suggestions:</p><p><br /></p><p>Applesauce</p><p>Fresh fruits</p><p>Fruit pie filling or topping</p><p>Canned fruit</p><p>maple syrup</p><p>Milk cream</p><p>Whipped cream</p><p><br /></p><p>How to Store and Reheat Cheese Blintze:</p><p><br /></p><p>Once the blintzes are made, let them cool before storing. Then put them in an airtight container (preferably not a bag so they don't break) and refrigerate for about 5 days.</p><p><br /></p><p>Then to reheat them put them on a baking sheet and bake them at 350 for about 5-10 minutes or until they are heated through. However, I think they are also delicious cold!</p><p><br /></p><p>Can you freeze cheeseburgers?</p><p><br /></p><p>These are good frozen! Place them in a container suitable for freezing and store them for up to 3 months. Just be sure to take them out and let them thaw before you're ready to bake them.</p>
